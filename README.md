## TL;DR in 90 seconds

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm i -g quallaa-cli

# Create a professional services billing system
quallaa outcome --template project-invoice-guardrails

# Or choose from 5 outcome pack templates
quallaa outcome  # Interactive selection

# Run evaluation harness
quallaa evaluators run --format html
open evaluators/scorecard.html

# Check system health
quallaa doctor --audit-secrets
```

This generates a production-ready project with business workflow scaffolding, JSON schema data contracts, API integrations, gold datasets for testing, and evaluation harnesses measuring accuracy, efficiency, and cost.

## üìä What Gets Measured

Every outcome template includes evaluators that measure:

- **Rework Ratio**: How often does someone intervene? (target: ‚â§5%)
- **Processing Time**: How fast per item? (target: ‚â§5s)
- **Unit Cost**: What does each operation cost? (target: ‚â§$0.10)

Run `quallaa evaluators run` to generate scorecards in HTML, JSON, or text format.
