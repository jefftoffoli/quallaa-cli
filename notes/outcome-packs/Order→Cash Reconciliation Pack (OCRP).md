Got it 👍 — let’s deep-dive into the **Order→Cash Reconciliation Pack (OCRP)**. I’ll treat this like a spec you could hand to engineering (for CLI scaffolding) *and* a sales one-pager you could show prospects.

# 🧩 Order→Cash Reconciliation Pack (OCRP)

## 1. Problem it solves

**The accounting & ops pain point:**

* Shopify/BigCommerce/WooCommerce → orders & refunds.
* Stripe/Adyen/PayPal → payouts, fees, chargebacks.
* QuickBooks Online/Xero/NetSuite → journal entries.
  💥 They rarely reconcile automatically. At month-end, controllers spend days matching orders vs. payouts vs. books, handling exceptions manually in spreadsheets.

**Consequences:**

* **Slow closes** (10–15 days instead of 2–3).
* **Hidden errors** (double-booked revenue, missing refunds).
* **High risk** (auditors find exceptions late).

---

## 2. Scope of the Pack

**Goal:** Automate *80%* of reconciliation, produce an **exception ledger** for the 20% edge cases.

**Inputs (via APIs):**

* Shopify API → Orders, Refunds
* Stripe API → Balance Transactions, Payouts
* QBO/Xero API → Journal Entries

**Core steps:**

1. **Ingest**: nightly pull from APIs.
2. **Normalize**: map Shopify Order IDs ↔ Stripe Charge IDs ↔ QBO Invoice IDs.
3. **Match**:

   * Orders ↔ Payments
   * Refunds ↔ Credits
   * Fees ↔ Expenses
4. **Reconcile**: check amounts, currencies, dates.
5. **Exceptions**: log mismatches (missing order, wrong amount, no payout).
6. **Report**:

   * Exception Ledger (CSV + optional Next.js table).
   * Reconciliation Summary (success rate, amounts matched vs. unmatched).
   * Evaluator Scorecard (accuracy %, rework ratio, time-to-close).

**Outputs:**

* `/reports/reconciliation.csv`
* `/reports/summary.json`
* `/reports/evaluator.html` (scorecard)

## 3. CLI Scaffold (target design)

```bash
# Generate a new OCRP project
quallaa init outcome order-cash-reco \
  --shopify-domain my-store \
  --stripe-mode test \
  --accounting qbo

# Run reconciliation
npm run reconcile

# Generate evaluator scorecard
quallaa evaluators run --report html
```

---

## 4. Repo structure

```
/contracts
  Order.json
  Payout.json
  JournalEntry.json
/integrations
  shopify.ts
  stripe.ts
  qbo.ts
/jobs
  reconcile.ts         # main pipeline
  nightly-cron.ts      # scheduled run
/evaluators
  gold-dataset.csv     # sample inputs
  expected-output.csv
  evaluator.test.ts    # scoring harness
/reports
  reconciliation.csv
  summary.json
  evaluator.html
/app
  /api/exceptions      # REST endpoint
  /exceptions          # (optional) Next.js UI
CLAUDE.md
```

---

## 5. Evaluator metrics (baked in)

* **Match Accuracy**: % of transactions correctly reconciled vs. gold data.
* **Exception Rate**: % of transactions flagged unresolved.
* **Rework Ratio**: manual interventions ÷ total matches.
* **Time-to-Output**: wall-clock run time.
* **Unit Cost**: infra cost ÷ reconciled transaction count.

👉 These numbers generate an **HTML scorecard** (`/reports/evaluator.html`) that sales can show as *proof of ROI*.

## 6. Exception handling

**CSV format:**

```
order_id, stripe_txn_id, qbo_entry_id, discrepancy_type, expected_amount, actual_amount, status
12345, ch_1N2A..., je_998, Missing_QBO, 120.00, null, open
12346, ch_1N2B..., je_999, Amount_Mismatch, 50.00, 45.00, open
```

**Optional Next.js UI (scaffolded):**

* Simple table with filters (Missing, Mismatch, Unmatched).
* Export button → CSV/PDF.
* Status toggle (“open” → “resolved”).

---

## 7. ICP fit

* **Ecommerce SMBs & Mid-market** → Shopify + Stripe + QBO/Xero.
* **Controllers & COOs** want faster closes, fewer errors.
* **Auditors** love exception ledgers (clear trail).

**Trigger events:**

* Business scales to 1k+ orders/month → manual reconciliation collapses.
* Finance team complains about HubSpot/Shopify/Stripe mismatch.
* Fundraising/due diligence → need reliable close process.

---

## 8. Sales messaging

* “Close your books in 2 days, not 2 weeks.”
* “Catch revenue leaks before auditors do.”
* “Reconciliation in code, not spreadsheets.”
* CTA: *Spin up a demo in 10 minutes with Quallaa CLI.*

---

## 9. Website page layout (Order→Cash Pack)

**Hero:** “Automated Reconciliation for Shopify + Stripe + QuickBooks/Xero.”
**Pain section:** Manual reconciliation is slow, error-prone.
**Solution section:** API-first pipeline, evaluator scorecard, exceptions ledger.
**Demo CTA:** CLI snippet + “Try it in demo mode.”
**Proof:** Benchmarks (Copilot study, SWE-bench) + Quallaa thesis (API > GUI).
**Next step:** Book a demo / Scaffold Pack with CLI.

---

## 10. Roadmap to MVP

* v1.2.0 CLI: add `init outcome order-cash-reco`.
* Scaffold connectors, contracts, evaluator harness.
* Demo repo: `order-cash-reco-demo` with fake Shopify/Stripe/QBO data.
* Website page with Quick Start snippet.

---

✅ With this, OCRP becomes the *flagship Pack*—it has the clearest ROI, the cleanest APIs, and the widest ICP base. Once live, it proves the Quallaa model (disposable repo, measurable outcome, API-first automation).

Would you like me to **mock up the `Order.json`, `Payout.json`, and `JournalEntry.json` contracts** (schemas) so you can drop them directly into the CLI scaffold? That’s the next step to making OCRP real.
