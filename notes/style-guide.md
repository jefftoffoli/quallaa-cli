# 📘 Steven Pinker–Inspired Style Guide

## 1. **Adopt Classic Style**

**Principle:** Write as if you are showing the reader something in the world, not performing or lecturing.

* ✅ Good: *“Consider a sentence as a path that leads the reader forward.”*
* ❌ Bad: *“The sentence constitutes a linearized instantiation of linguistic structures.”*

👉 *Imagine pointing out something interesting to an intelligent peer standing beside you.*

---

## 2. **Escape the Curse of Knowledge**

**Principle:** Don’t assume readers know what you know.

* ✅ Good: *“The hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory, helps us form new experiences.”*
* ❌ Bad: *“The hippocampus encodes episodic memory.”*

👉 Use definitions, examples, and analogies. Pretend your reader is smart, but not already inside your head.

---

## 3. **Clarity Before Rules**

**Principle:** Grammar rules exist to aid comprehension—not as commandments.

* Splitting infinitives:

  * ✅ *“She decided to boldly go where no one had gone before.”*
  * ❌ *“She decided boldly to go where no one had gone before.”* (awkward)
* Ending with a preposition:

  * ✅ *“That’s the person I was talking to.”*
  * ❌ *“That’s the person to whom I was talking.”* (stuffy unless in legal/formal tone)

👉 Break “rules” if obeying them muddies the sentence.

## 4. **Respect Cognitive Load**

**Principle:** Readers can only hold so much in working memory. Structure helps.

* **Chunking:** Use shorter sentences when introducing complex ideas.
* **Parallelism:** Keep structures consistent.

  * ✅ *“She likes hiking, biking, and swimming.”*
  * ❌ *“She likes hiking, biking, and to swim.”*
* **Avoid garden paths:** Don’t force rereads.

  * ✅ *“The horse that was tired stumbled.”*
  * ❌ *“The horse raced past the barn fell.”*

👉 Use punctuation and rhythm to guide readers smoothly.

## 5. **Use Concrete, Vivid Language**

**Principle:** Abstract ideas become memorable through imagery and example.

* ✅ *“A bad idea spreads like a weed.”*
* ❌ *“A suboptimal conceptual framework proliferates across domains.”*

👉 Favor words that appeal to the senses. Use metaphors sparingly, but strategically.

---

## 6. **Balance Formality with Flow**

**Principle:** Good prose has rhythm. Avoid monotony.

* Mix sentence lengths:

  * Short punch: *“It worked.”*
  * Longer follow-up: *“But only after we adjusted the parameters to account for the unexpected shift in demand.”*

👉 Read aloud—if it sounds robotic or pompous, rewrite.

---

## 7. **Trim the Fat**

**Principle:** Omit needless words (but don’t strip style).

* ✅ *“Because”* not *“Due to the fact that.”*
* ✅ *“Now”* not *“At this point in time.”*
* ✅ *“Although”* not *“Despite the fact that.”*

👉 Concision sharpens meaning without flattening voice.

---

## 8. **Revise with Empathy**

**Principle:** Editing is about kindness to the reader.

* Look for jargon. Replace it with plain equivalents.
* Move important info to the front of the sentence.
* Break long paragraphs into digestible chunks.

👉 Revision is the stage where clarity is forged.

---

## 9. **Don’t Fear Style and Personality**

**Principle:** Good writing isn’t just clear—it’s engaging.

* Use humor, metaphor, and rhythm where appropriate.
* Let your voice come through. Pinker insists: *style is not the enemy of substance.*
